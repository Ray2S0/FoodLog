** Forge! for Gitlab and Github issues. 
Right so magit does basic git, forge does the gitlab/github interfaces.

https://magit.vc/manual/forge.html#Setup-for-Githubcom

My .gitconfig is fine.

Forge needs me to feed some variables to it. When I SPC SPC forge-add-repository I get this error:

Required Github token (Ray2S0^forge for api.github.com) does not exist.

After I've got it setup for Github I will need to set it up for the SSC Gitlab. 

** shopping lists
- requires owncloud to sync to phone
- Could possibly have recurring amazon and instacart orders
- honestly i want recurring "go buy this" lists that are for me
- with estimated price tags


** SQLite

** Ratio Calculator
- elisp in an org babel code block?
- SQLite table that I can push the numbers in?
- Honestly I'll probably start with an org table.
